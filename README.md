# Real-time Water Management System using IoT
This applied research project implements a real-time water management system using IoT technology to monitor water quality parameters, optimize water usage, and provide essential information to users using Cayenne. It allows for remote monitoring, control of water flow, and data transmission to the cloud for analysis and visualization. 

The equipment components used in the described research project include Arduino Mega (microcontroller), pH sensor, turbidity sensor, temperature sensor, relay, solenoid valve, submersible pump, flowmeter, and IoT module.
